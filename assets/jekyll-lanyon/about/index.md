##Hi, I'm Tommy

###I love everything about <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)'>Media</a>: its consumption, production, and distribution; and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet'>Internet</a>: for all the affordances it provides Digital Media.

###I work hard to help people be heard on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web'>the Web</a>.

###*This is my voice*: **Welcome!**

## About the Website

so i've been working on this design for awhile. there are two layers: technomad and wommy. technomad is the greater application/template/workflow that allows/guides/facilitates the artist to compose/produce/distribute digital media. wommy is my manifestation of that.

its funny that i say that wommy is a manifestation of technomad, because actually, technomad is the distillation of wommy. i have been explicitly working on my own digital presence since 2010. it has taken many twists and turns, been shelfed and picked up again, but, has always stuck with me. and for that reason, i know that i probably will never stop contributing to it, at least in some way, shape, or form. 

everything i have done since i left my home in metro Detroit for college in Chicago, has been towards this.

my original project in the summer of 2011 was a ToDo app, called River. At the time, i had no/none/zip/zero/zilch coding experience. I just finished up my first year of [DePaul](depaul.edu), which i transferred to after two years at [Columbia College Chicago](colum.edu). My transition was far rougher than i had ever imagined, the majority of it being needlessly so, artifically created by DePaul. 

river was first incepted in the spring of 2011


that  created technomad by manifesting wommy. i created  creating principles.
